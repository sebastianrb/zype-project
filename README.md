# zype-project repo

#### Live demo: https://sebastianrb.github.io/zype-project/

#### Notes about the project:

* As stipulated in the project instructions, I use predominantly pure JavaScript and some jQuery (no other libraries or frameworks, and no jQuery plugins)

* The UI is fully responsive and works nicely on mobile devices

* I completed this project using a Gulp-based workflow

* I used the Sass preprocessor to generate the CSS

* All of the development code is processed (minified, concatenated, etc...) and the production-ready code is saved to the `dest` directory. `index.html` only references files in this directory
